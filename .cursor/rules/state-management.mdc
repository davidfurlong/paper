- For global app state, prefer Redux Toolkit where necessary and keep global state minimal.
- Use React Query (TanStack Query) for server state, caching, and invalidation. Co-locate queries/mutations within `src/hooks/`.
- Use React Hook Form for forms; integrate with Shadcn/UI controls.
- Isolate complex state logic inside custom hooks; keep components declarative.
