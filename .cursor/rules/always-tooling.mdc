- Use Bun (v1.2.5). Do not use Node.js, npm, pnpm, or Vite commands in this repo.
- Install dependencies with Bun.
- Lint and format before commits using Biome.
- After any TypeScript edit, run a type check and fix all errors until none remain.
- Assume the dev server is already running; do not start or stop dev/build tasks from the Agent.

Common commands:

```bash
bun install
bun x @biomejs/biome check --write --unsafe ./src/*
bunx tsc --noEmit
```
