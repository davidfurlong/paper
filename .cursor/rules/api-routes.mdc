- Follow RESTful conventions within Next.js App Router APIs.
- Keep handlers cohesive and domain-focused; delegate to `src/lib` and `src/utils` when appropriate.
- Reuse types from `src/types` to ensure consistent IO contracts.
- Integrate Web3 protocols (EFP/ECP/ENS) via utilities in `src/lib` and `src/utils`.
